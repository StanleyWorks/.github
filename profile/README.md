## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **StanleyWorks**. This organization serves as the home for my professional coding projects. Here, I've gathered a collection of work from various client engagements, aiming to keep my main profile streamlined and focused. Unfortunately, due to the nature of client projects, most repositories here are private. However, I'll be sharing insights and discussing these projects on my [Medium](https://stanleymasinde.medium.com).

### **A Bit About Me**

I'm Stanley, passionate about Software Engieering. Through StanleyWorks, I'm showcasing the breadth of my technical abilities, even if the code itself isn't always open for public viewing.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Private Repositories:** These contain client-specific work, where I've applied various technologies and methodologies tailored to specific business needs.
- **Occasional Public Projects:** When possible, I'll share tools, libraries, or projects that can benefit the community.
